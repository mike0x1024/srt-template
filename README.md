# Soul Resonance Token (SRT)

## Introduction:
SRT(Soul Resonance Token), introduces a novel token protocol. Much like SBT, SRT lacks support for transfer methods, prohibiting users from moving SRT assets between different accounts. What sets SRT apart is its utilization of the mint() and burn() methods via the Bonding Curve mechanism, facilitating pricing and trading functionalities for SRT. Consequently, SRT represents an asset type that is non-transferable yet tradable. By merging the features of SBT's soul binding and the tradability of traditional ERC20 assets, SRT effectively closes the gap between SBT and conventional ERC20 tokens.

## How to use
```shell
# clone this repository 
git submodule update --init --recursive  ## initialize submodule dependencies
npm install ## install development dependencies
forge build
forge test
```

## Characteristics:
### Non-transferable:
The inability to transfer SRT tokens ensures that they remain securely bound to the account where they were originally minted or acquired.
### Tradable:
Despite being non-transferable, SRT tokens are still tradable. This means that they can be bought and sold on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or other platforms that support trading of SRT tokens. The trading functionality allows users to exchange SRT tokens for other assets or currencies within the ecosystem in a unique way.
### Customizable Market Curve:
SRT implements a customizable market curve through the Bonding Curve mechanism. This curve determines the pricing and supply dynamics of SRT tokens based on the amount of tokens in circulation. By customizing the market curve, developers can tailor the token economics of SRT to suit specific use cases or objectives.

## Security Considerations
While we maintain high standards for code quality and test coverage throughout the development process of this project, it is crucial to acknowledge that the overall security of the implementation cannot be guaranteed at this time. The Soul Resonance Token (SRT) protocol and its associated smart contracts have not yet undergone a comprehensive, independent security audit by a reputable third-party organization.

As with any blockchain-based project, particularly those involving novel token mechanisms like SRT, there may be unforeseen vulnerabilities or edge cases that could potentially be exploited. Users and implementers should exercise caution and conduct their own thorough risk assessment before deploying or interacting with SRT contracts in production environments.

### Key points to consider:
The absence of a formal security audit means that potential vulnerabilities may exist in the codebase.
The unique nature of SRT, combining non-transferability with tradability, introduces new dynamics that may not have been fully explored in terms of security implications.
The customizable market curve feature, while offering flexibility, also introduces additional complexity that could potentially be a source of security risks if not implemented or configured correctly.
As with any smart contract system, the SRT protocol may be subject to common blockchain vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks, front-running, or other forms of manipulation.
The interaction between SRT and existing token standards (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155) may introduce unforeseen complications or security considerations.

We strongly recommend that any implementation of the SRT protocol undergo a rigorous security audit by experienced blockchain security professionals before being deployed in a live environment. Additionally, we encourage the community to review the code, provide feedback, and report any potential security issues they may discover.
